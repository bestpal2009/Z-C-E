            <h3 id="title">About Us</h3>
            <p id="txt-limit">We were founded in February 2025 by ZepoTheConqueror. He got to recruiting, and many of our members joined early in the Z-C-E's days. 
            Some of our original members include sad boi (@Lizardking12345) and nova (@bestpal2009). From there, the Z-C-E exploded, quickly gaining traction in the 
            Starscape galactic stage. Some of our members, such as Donofett and 2006chronicles (@cdfjbad), rose to positions of prominence within the faction. We make 
            money through mining and hauling, although PvE is one of our trades as well. We have dealings with major factions such as OOFERS and FROST, and many more with smaller ones 
            such as TGP. We are semi-active and host events weekly for our members to join.</p>

                <p style="max-width: 60%">One of our members, Polimata (@muneco1717), betrayed the faction and became an enemy. 
                    A new verification system was created to prevent an event like this from happening again. We also made deals 
                    with factions such as FROST and TGP. We started our first bout of faction advertising, courtesy of Newswire.</p>
